This is a Daniel Gehuan Liu's knowledge base.
It is public and DO NOT record any secret here!!!


It is build on Obsidian (a commercial md editor) and https://github.com/obsidian-html/obsidian-html version 2.0.2 .  
It requires python 3 and pip to build static html. see [here](export_obsidian_to_html)  

> in order to publish to Cloudflare pages, I modified some python codes to let obsidian-html runs on python 3.7.
